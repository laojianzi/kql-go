/*
The goal of this project is to build a KQL(kibana query language) parser in Go with the following key features:

  - Parse KQL(kibana query language) query into AST

  - output AST to KQL(kibana query language) query

This project is inspired by [github.com/AfterShip/clickhouse-sql-parser]
and [https://github.com/cloudspannerecosystem/memefish].
Both of these are SQL parsers implemented in Go.
